# 21_day_responsive_layout_course
Taking notes here:
## Day 1
- CSS is responsive by default, but we tend to make it unresponsive be doing things like setting the height
### Challenge:
- Tried text-align center but that didn't work... Soln was margin: 0 auto. Need to check the inner container in the future when trying to center text
