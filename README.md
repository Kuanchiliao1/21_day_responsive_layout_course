# 21_day_responsive_layout_course
Course by Kevin Powell

Notes:
## Day 1
- CSS is responsive by default, but we tend to make it unresponsive be doing things like setting the height
### Challenge:
- Tried text-align center but that didn't work... Soln was margin: 0 auto. Need to check the inner container in the future when trying to center text

## Day 2
- Using em units can be really good for padding on buttons because those scale with the text size
- rem is determined by the html element font-size. One use case is it enables a developer to change font-size of an entire section with media queries instead of changing every px value individually
